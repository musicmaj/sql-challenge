Module 9 Challenge, SQL
For this challenge we received CSV files which were used in pgAdmin 4 to create tables with primary, composite, and foreign keys. Following the creation of the tables, an ERD was created in pgAdmin 4 as well to visualize the relationships between the tables.
Finally, the query file contains the Data Analysis portion with the 8 required queries for the assignment showing the capabilities of queries from multiple tables to extract information, group it, and sort it.
